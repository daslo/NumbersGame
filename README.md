# NumbersGame
This repo defines a .NET SDK that can be used for solving a "numbers game" (the integer-maths puzzle popularised by C4's Countdown.) .NET developers must implement the ISolutionProvider interface in order to provide a compliant algorithm. Developers _may_ reuse other parts of the SDK, although no particular implementation is mandated. Also contains a project to expose the numbers game as a web service, to allow web clients to compete.
