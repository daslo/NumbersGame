The competition between algorithms is done as follows:


A random series of games is presented to each algorithm to solve. 
The games get progressively harder; the minimum number of operations required to complete each game is increaased in waves.
During each wave, a mixture of Countdown, CountdownPlus and Random8 game boards will be generated.


Each algorithm is timed for its solution via the GetSolution method only.
Algorithms that produce results in less numbers of operations immediately trump those that take more.
Those with the same number of operations are differentiated according to the time taken.

Each game contributes a point to the victor.
